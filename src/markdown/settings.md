# Xano Auth

In order to setup Xano authentication in your WeWeb project, there are three pre-requisites:

‚úÖ 1- you already have an account with Xano, it‚Äôs free for up to 10,000 records

‚úÖ 2- you have a user table in your Xano database with at least two fields: login and password

‚úÖ 3- you have the three authentication API endpoints in Xano


Let‚Äôs walk you through step 2 and 3 before we dive into the actual WeWeb setup üôÇ

## Setup a User Table in Your Xano Database

Your user table should include at least two fields:

* one field where you store the **login**, for example, a string field with a name or an email field with an email address, and
* one field of field type ‚Äú**password**‚Äù where you store the encrypted password.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It‚Äôs important that you choose the field type ‚Äúpassword‚Äù when creating your user table in Xano. ‚ö†Ô∏è

This will ensure that:

* you can use Xano‚Äôs authentication API points, and that
* the user input is encrypted when the user first creates an account with your web-app.

‚ö°Ô∏è Pro tip: if you‚Äôre starting from scratch in Xano, you can use the ‚ÄúStarter‚Äù template in their Marketplace.

## Create Authentication API Endpoints in Xano

For Xano authentication to work, you need three API endpoints:

1. signup
2. login
3. me

![three auth endpoints in xano-api view|690x227](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/weweb/original/1X/bd1e99c86874c04ac77dc2ab1335e92597f44f86.jpeg)


If you‚Äôre using a Xano template that includes authentication, you‚Äôll find these endpoints in the API sub-menu.

Otherwise, you‚Äôll need to create these three endpoints yourself by going to ‚ÄúAPI‚Äù > ‚ÄúAdd API Endpoint‚Äù > ‚ÄúAuthentication‚Äù

## Copy Xano Authentication Endpoints Into WeWeb

In WeWeb, you‚Äôll need to copy/paste the URL of each Xano API endpoint:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: the order in which endpoints are displayed in Xano may vary. Make sure to copy the correct URL in each WeWeb ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Create Roles and Permissions

### Adding Roles to Xano API Endpoint
In order to gate content in WeWeb based on user roles and permissions, you first need to create a `role` column in your Xano user base.


If you have a column with user roles in your Xano user base, you will be able to add it to the output of your `me` endpoint:
![add role ro me output in xano auth|690x388](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/weweb/original/1X/401d03fed7da12c6ea2b31c9605e9cb79028ad57.gif)

Once you've added roles to the output of the `me` endpoint of your Xano auth, you can add them to WeWeb.

### Telling WeWeb Where to Find the User Role Info in Xano

Here, it's in the `role` column so that's what we type in:

Then, you can add user groups where user roles match the data in Xano.

### Adding User Groups in WeWeb

Note that user role categories in Xano match the user roles in WeWeb:

#### User roles in WeWeb

## Gate Content Based on User Roles
Once you've setup user roles in WeWeb, you can `Manage access to pages`
 and define rules for `Private access`:
